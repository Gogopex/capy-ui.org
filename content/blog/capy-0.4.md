**Reminder: Capy is NOT ready for use in production as I'm still making breaking changes**

[Capy](https://github.com/capy-ui/capy) is a **GUI framework** for Zig made with performance, cross-compilation and native widgets in mind. The goal is to be able to seamlessly cross-compile from any platform to any other one. This includes Windows, Linux, WebAssembly, and soon will include macOS, Android and iOS.
